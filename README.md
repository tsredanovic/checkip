## Installation

```bash
pip install checkip
```


## Usage

### Get IP
Use provider's code to fetch your public IP from that provider.

```python
from checkip import get_ip

get_ip('cloudflare')
```

### Resolve IP
Use multiple provider's codes to resolve your most commonly returned public IP.

```python
from checkip import resolve_ip

resolve_ip(['cloudflare', 'dyndns', 'freedns'])
```

### Register Custom Provider
You can create your own custom providers by extending the `BaseProvider` base class.

Attribute `code` must be defined on each custom provider which can not match any already registered code.

To succesfully get an IP from a custom provider you can either:

1. Define attribute `URL` on your custom provider class. By default the IP address will be parsed from that URL's response.

```python
from checkip.providers import BaseProvider, register_provider
from checkip import get_ip

class MyProvider(BaseProvider):
    code = 'myprovider'
    url = 'https://example.com/ip'

register_provider(MyProvider)

get_ip('myprovider')
```

2. Overwrite the provider's `get_ip` method for even more customization:

```python
from checkip.providers import BaseProvider, register_provider
from checkip import get_ip

class MyProvider(BaseProvider):
    code = 'myprovider'
    
    def get_ip(self):
        response = requests.get('https://example.com/ip.json')
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()['ip']

register_provider(MyProvider)

get_ip('myprovider')
```


## CLI Usage

### Get IP
Use provider's code to fetch your public IP from that provider.

```bash
$ checkip get cloudflare
```

### Resolve IP
Use multiple provider's codes to resolve your most commonly returned public IP.

```bash
$ checkip resolve cloudflare dyndns freedns
```
